# SortingVisualizer
Made This Sorting Visualizer Web App, This is an awesome web app that makes you understand the 5 mostly used sorting techniques - 1.Selection Sort 2.Bubble Sort 3.Insertion Sort 4.Quick Sort 5.Merge Sort It shows you how the algorithms are working behind the scenes how they are comparing how they are selecting how they are swapping this not only give you look of the working but also this app gives you the algorithm time and space complexity in detail.

Advantage of this Web App :
1.)Gives you the brief theory of each of the 5 algorithm with their time and space complexity
2.)The App gives you the access to increase or decrease the size of the array
3.)You can randomize the Array again and again
4.)It gives you the speed controller of sorting
